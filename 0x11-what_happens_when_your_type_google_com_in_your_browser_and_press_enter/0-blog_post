1.DNS Request:
The URL is a human-readable address, but computers on the internet communicate using IP addresses. The DNS system translates the human-readable domain name (www.google.com) into an IP address (e.g., 172.217.164.68) through a series of DNS queries.
2.TCP/IP:
Once the IP address is obtained, the browser initiates a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with the server. TCP is a core protocol for transmitting data on the internet, ensuring reliable and ordered delivery of data packets between the client (your computer) and the server.
3.Firewall:
Before the connection is established, it may pass through firewalls, which act as security barriers. Firewalls filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules. They play a crucial role in protecting networks from unauthorized access and potential threats.
4.HTTPS/SSL Encryption:
For secure communication, many modern websites, including Google, use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) with SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security). This encryption ensures that the data exchanged between your browser and the server remains confidential and secure from eavesdroppers.
5.Load Balancer:
Large-scale websites like Google often use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers. Load balancers enhance performance, improve availability, and prevent overload on a single server. They intelligently distribute requests, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
6.Web Server:
Once the TCP connection is established and the HTTPS handshake is completed, your request reaches the web server. The web server is responsible for handling HTTP requests, processing them, and returning the appropriate response. Google, like many others, uses specialized web servers like Google Web Server (GWS).
7. Application Server:
Behind the scenes, application servers process more complex operations. They execute server-side scripts, interact with databases, and generate dynamic content based on user requests. In Google's case, sophisticated application servers handle tasks related to search queries, user authentication, and personalized content delivery.
8. Database:
The final destination in this journey is the database. Application servers often retrieve or update information stored in databases to fulfill user requests. In the case of Google, a massive and distributed infrastructure supports the storage and retrieval of vast amounts of data, indexing the web, and providing relevant search results.
